Sidekick

## Motivation
I'm fed up of the complexity required to host my side projects. While some services shine as lamp post in this era of heroku replacmenets, i.e fly.io, I believe simple VPS can go a long way. The motivation behind sidekick is to make hosting your side projects as simple as possible, as cheap as possible and as production ready as possible; you will be surprised how much traffic a 12$/mo instance on DO can handle.

# Sidekick
From baremetal to live side projects in minutes not hours and for the price of a couple of coffees a month

## Inspiration
- Fly.io
- Kamal.dev

## Vision
Simple CLI tool that can help you:
- Setup your VPS
- Deploy all your side projects on a single VPS
- Load balance multiple container per project 
- Deploy new versions with Zero downtime
- Deploy preview environments with ease
- Manage env secrets in a secure way
- Connect any number of domains and subdomains to your projects with ease

## Features
- Deploy any application from a dockerfile
- Connect any domain to any of your side projects hosted on your VPS
- Automatic HTTPS and TLS certs for all your projects

## Roadmap
- Zero downtime deployments
- Inject env secrets securely at run-time
- Deploy preview environments of any application with ease
- Handle more complex projects built with docker compose
